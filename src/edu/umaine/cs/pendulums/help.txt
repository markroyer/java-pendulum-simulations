Pendulum Simulation
By Mark Royer

Select the desired simulation by clicking on Pendulum, Spring Pendulum, Double 
Pendulum, or Double Spring Pendulum.

Change the initial angle and length of the rod, the mass of the pendulum 
head/joint, and spring k amount by editing the spinner values.

a1: initial angle of inner pendulum
a2: initial angle of outer pendulum
l1: length of inner pendulum
l2: length of outer pendulum
m1: mass of inner pendulum
m2: mass of outer pendulum
k1: spring constant for inner pendulum
k2: spring constant for outer pendulum  

Alternatively, if the user hovers over the simulation widow, then he or she may
use the following hot keys to increase or decrease the values.

value:  - / +
 
a1:     a / A
a2:     s / S
l1:     d / D
l2:     f / F
m1:     z / Z
m2:     x / X
k1:     c / C
k2:     v / V

Quit application: q
Restart current simulation: r

A user may save the current values to the drop down menu.  When the values are 
selected the simulation is setup (but not started) with those values.

To start the simulation the user can push the "Reset/Start" button.

A user can pause/resume the simulation by selecting or deselecting the "Run Sim"
check box.

A user can pause/resume the rotating by selecting or deselecting the "Rotate"
check box.

A user can decrease/increase the simulation speed by using the "Speed" spinner.

A user may rotate the world by click and dragging with the left mouse button.

A user may also zoom-in or zoom-out by using the mouse wheel.
